Vitamins are consumable items that can be purchased at the Pokémon League in all regions. They can be applied to a Pokémon to adjust certain stats. Each Pokémon can consume a total of 5 vitamins per unlocked region. Protein is first available in Kanto, Calcium is unlocked upon reaching Hoenn, and Carbos is unlocked upon reaching Unova.

If you are interested in the "best" Vitamin distribution for each Pokémon, you can search for the relevant Pokémon as each individual page has a table with the Vitamin distribution per Region.


## How to use {#how-to-use}
Go to `Start Menu` → `Items` → `Item Bag`, select the vitamin and select a Pokémon to use it on.
Vitamins can be removed at any point by right clicking the Pokémon or toggling the give/take button.
